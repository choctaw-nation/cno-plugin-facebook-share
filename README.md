# CNO Facebook Share

A simple way to allow devs to create "Share to Facebook" links that pre-populate posts.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the plugin

The zip file can be found attached to the [latest release](https://github.com/choctaw-nation/cno-plugin-facebook-share/releases) on Github.

### 2. Enter your app ID in the Plugin's setting

Make sure you've added the appropriate app domains to the app you've created with [Meta's developer platform](https://developers.facebook.com).

### 3. Use the `CNO_Facebook_Link_Generator` class however you see fit!

It is a globally accessible class, so simply indstantiate and use its 2 methods (`(get)_the_href` and `(get_)the_link`).

_There are technically 4 methods, but the class is built with a WordPress-y API so there are essentially only two methods_.
